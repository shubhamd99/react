## Intersection Observer API

Intersection Observer is a web-based API that enables developers to detect when a specific element intersects with another element or the viewport.
You can use this API to monitor any changes in the visibility of an element as it intersects with another element, or exits / enters the viewport.

### Scroll Animations

It's worth mentioning that although using the Intersection Observer for scroll animations is effective, there are newer approaches to implementing reveal-on-scroll animations in React. These approaches include the use of animation libraries such as Framer Motion and GSAP.
