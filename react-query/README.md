## React Query

React Query is a powerful library developed by TanStack that simplifies data fetching and state management in React applications. It provides a straightforward way to manage remote data and keep it in sync with the UI.
React Query is a JavaScript library designed to simplify the complex task of data fetching and caching in React applications. It offers a set of hooks and utilities that enable you to manage data from various sources, including REST APIs, GraphQL, or even local state, effortlessly.

Key Features:

- Declarative Data Fetching: React Query promotes a declarative approach to data fetching. You define queries and mutations using hooks like useQuery and useMutation. This leads to cleaner and more organized code.
- Automatic Caching: React Query includes a built-in cache that stores query results. It automatically updates data when mutations occur, ensuring your UI remains consistent.
- Background Data Sync: It can automatically refetch data in the background, keeping your data fresh without manual intervention.
- Pagination and Infinite Scrolling: React Query provides utilities for handling pagination and infinite scrolling effortlessly.
- Optimistic Updates: You can implement optimistic updates with ease, making your app feel more responsive.

## NextJS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
